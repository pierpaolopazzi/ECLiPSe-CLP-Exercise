The problem:

A nurse needs to visit some patients at their home. Every single patient has to been visited in a time window.
The file pazienti.pl has for every patient a fact:
  paziente(ID, OrarioMinimo, OrarioMassimo),
where
  ID is the unique number of patient,
  OrarioMinimio and OrarioMassimo is the slot time of the visit
File pazienti.pl contains another fact:
  distanza(patient1, patient2, cost).
where 
  cost is the cost to go from patient1 to patient2.
Write a CLP(FD) program for searching the best path minimizing the distance. 
Consider the visit a snapshot (has not duration).
