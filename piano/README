Grandmother Luisa, has done one of her special cakes. Her nephew Carletto, with his friends
Pierino and Tommaso, come up with a plan to get the cake.
Each boy will take care of a part of the plan. 
They have to decide who and when performs each action. 

- Carletto can distract the grandmother for 5 minutes, Pierino for 3, Tommaso for 2.
- Carletto can distract the dog for 4 minutes, Pierino for 2, Tommaso for 3.
- Carletto can substract the cake in 2 minutes, Pierino in 5, Tommaso in 4.

They can start to distract the dog only 1 minute after the grandmother start to speek with one of them
and only 1 minute before she finishes. 

They can take the cake only when both the grandmother and the dog are distracted for all the duration. 



In this simple problem we use the predicate 'element'.
For example, in "element(Nonna, [5,3,2], DurataNonna)" we associate [5,3,2] at the children 
[1,2,3], and we put it into the 'DurataNonna' variable. So when we do the "alldifferent" and 
all the constraints, we obtain exactly what we want.
